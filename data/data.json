You can use white sugar, brown sugar, or panela. Line the oven tray with parchment or parchment paper and form the oatmeal cookies by making small balls with your hands and then flattening them. For crispy oatmeal cookies, the trick is not to make them too thick. 3. With the oven preheated to 200 ºC with heat up and down and with the fan function (if you have one), bake the oatmeal cookies for about 10 minutes or until they are golden brown. They should be slightly toasted, not too much. 4. Let them cool on a wire rack and enjoy them with a cup of tea or coffee.",
